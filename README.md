#### Overview: 
* Project: Telangana Tourism Potentials and Challenges
* Domain: Tourism Sector
* Function: Revenue / Municipal Administration 
#### About Telangana:
Telangana Is one of the leading states of India. It
has published its tourism data under its open data policy.
#### Problem Statement:
As a data analyst, I saw this as an opportunity to expand my skills and show my work on a bigger scale. My idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.
#### Task:
* Our Task is to analyse and answer the questions provided.
* The target audience is top-level officials.
#### Tools Used:  
* Microsoft Excel: For Simple Calculations
* Power Query Editor: For Cleaning the Data and arranging the data in the required table format
* Power BI: For Visualization charts
* DAX: For Calculating important metrics like CAGR, Footfall Ratio's etc.
#### Findings & Suggestions : 
* Telangana State tourism development corporation's services are not upto the mark.
* Hyderabad intake of domestic visitors has been drastically reducing.
* States like Mulugu, Warangal (Rural), Mancherial, Hyderabad are the states with high potential of growth.
* Govt. should make sure the tourism packages provided are worth and legally approved.
* Govt. can organise cultural events specifically in the months of December, January, February, June
* A better traffic management would do wonders
